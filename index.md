<strong>It is easy to check whether you have opened the
        correct workspace. Eclipse window should look like <a
        class="thumbnail" href="outcomes_menu.png">this<span><img
            src="images/Screenshot028a.png" /></span></a>. Specifically, if you do
        not see ProjectTemplate in the Package Explorer tab on the left
        of the window (or you see additional projects), <span
        class="underline">you did not open the correct workspace</span>.
        If the workspace does not look right, you can switch to the
        correct one by selecting, in Eclipse's menu, File &gt; Switch
        Workspace &gt; Other... and then navigating to the correct
        workspace folder on your disk.
